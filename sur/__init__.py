"""sur --- Submodule Updater

Anyway, what does sur stand for?  It's nothing as of now.  Actually I named it
after submodule-update-request, but as its architecture and goals were slighly
shifted, I had to rename it to Submodule Updater.  However, the Python package
name sur still remains as it has been, because it's quite bother to rename.
